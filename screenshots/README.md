## Kubernetes

- To verify Kubernetes pods are deployed properly
  ![kubectl get pods output printscreen](./evidences/output-get-pods.PNG)
- To verify Kubernetes services are properly set up
  ![kubectl describe services output printscreen](./evidences/output-describe-services.PNG)

- To verify that you have horizontal scaling set against CPU usage
  ![kubectl describe hpa output printscreen](./evidences/output-describe-hpa.PNG)

- To verify that you have set up logging with a backend application
  - Customer submitted a request, which CorrelationId was eb31f9b1-b379-494b-9359-9f129b4be06b, what could identify him. It was send as part of the haders from a request from the browser.
    - In the image below, you see that in the request header we inserted a correlation id.
      ![kubectl get pods output printscreen](./evidences/frontend-header-request.png)
    - In the image below, we have the logs of the pod that handled the request, and by doing it a log printing the correlation id was printed as log.
